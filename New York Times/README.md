This script will fetch the latest 10 results about any articles matcing the input field form NY Times, display the heading, snippet of the article and also present with a URL to visit the actual article.

I have used a sample API key, which might not always work depending upon the hits in a given time. Feel free to create a new API key and use it in place of the sample-key
